def completion#ultisnips#complete(): string
    # UltiSnips#SnippetsInCurrentScope() is a public function provided by the{{{
    # UltiSnips plugin.

    # By default, it returns a Vim dictionary with the snippets whose trigger
    # matches the current word.
    # We pass it the argument `1`, because we want *all* snippets information of
    # current buffer.  Indeed, the current word will probably be incomplete.
    # That's why we call this function in the first place.

    # When we call it like this, it automatically creates the variable
    # `g:current_ulti_dict_info` where the info will be stored.
    # The contents of the dictionary is as follows:
    #
    #    - keys      triggers
    #    - values    dictionaries, each with 2 keys:
    #
    #        * file location where the snippet is defined
    #        * optional description included in the snippet
    #
    # By testing if the output of `UltiSnips#SnippetsInCurrentScope()` is an
    # empty dictionary, we also create the variable `g:current_ulti_dict_info`.

    # The items of the list can be simple strings, OR dictionaries.
    # The OR is not exlusive: some item may be strings, while others are
    # dictionaries.
    # The dictionaries can only contain special items.
    # They are all optional, except 'word' which is mandatory:
    #
    #    - word     the text that will be inserted (MANDATORY)
    #    - abbr     abbr; short form of the word to be displayed in the menu
    #    - menu     extra text for the popup menu, displayed after "word"/"abbr"
    #    - info     more info for the preview window
    #    - kind     single letter indicating the type of completion
    #
    #         v	variable
    #         f	function or method
    #         m	member of a struct or class

    #         d	#define or macro

    #                     comparing items to be equal; w
    #
    #    - dup      flag; when non-zero the item will be added even when
    #               another one with the same word is already present in
    #               the list
    #
    #    - empty    flag; when non-zero this item will be added even when
    #               it is an empty string

    # filter(...)->map(...)
    # →
    # convert the triggers into dictionaries with additional info (description)
    #
    # The output of `map(...)` is a valid list to pass to `complete()`, because
    # its dictionaries contain only valid keys:
    #
    #    - word
    #    - menu
    #    - dup
    #
    # Why do we add the flag `dup` to each dictionary?
    # Because, we could have 2 snippets with the same trigger but different
    # descriptions.
    # It would probably be an error on our part, but now we would be aware of
    # the error.
    # IOW, `dup` = duplicate detector.
